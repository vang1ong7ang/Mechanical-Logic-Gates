# Mechanical-Logic-Gates

Welcome to **Mechanical-Logic-Gates**—a repository dedicated to the exploration and documentation of logic gates built entirely from mechanical components such as levers, gears, sliders, and linkages.

## Purpose

This project investigates a fundamental question:  
**Is it possible to design mechanical logic gates (beyond NOT gates) that operate without relying on friction, elasticity, springs, gravity, or powered controls—using only pure, frictionless mechanical motion?**

- **NOT Gate:**  
  Simple to implement—a lever or two gears can invert a signal (one side goes up, the other goes down).
- **The Challenge:**  
  For gates like AND, OR, NAND, or NOR, traditional mechanical designs typically require reset mechanisms (springs, elastic bands, gravity) to restore their initial position after an operation. These elements introduce friction, wear, and external dependencies.
- **Our Goal:**  
  Discover and share designs that utilize only mechanical movement—gears (including non-circular), planetary/differential gears, levers, and linkages—without any elastic, spring, gravitational, or powered reset mechanisms.

> **Note:** While friction in moving parts is unavoidable in reality, our focus is on eliminating additional sources of wear and mechanical complexity.

## Designs
