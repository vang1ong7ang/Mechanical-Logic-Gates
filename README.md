# Mechanical-Logic-Gates

This repository documents the **design of mechanical logic gates**—devices that perform logical operations using only mechanical components (such as levers, gears, or sliders) rather than electronics.

## Theoretical Exploration

A central question explored here is:  
**Can mechanical logic gates (beyond NOT gates) be designed without relying on friction, elasticity, springs, gravity, or powered controls—using only frictionless motions?**

- **Example:**  
  A NOT gate is trivial: a lever or two gears can invert a signal (one side goes up, the other down).
- **Challenge:**  
  For gates like AND or OR (and their universal forms, NAND/NOR), typical mechanical designs require return mechanisms (springs, elastic bands, or gravity) to reset the gate to its initial state. These introduce wear and tear.
- **Goal:**  
  Seek designs that use only pure mechanical motion—gears (including non-circular), planetary/differential gears, levers, etc.—with no elastic, spring, gravitational, or powered reset mechanisms.

While friction in gears is unavoidable in practice, the focus is on eliminating additional sources of wear.
